#  Sales Forecasting Dashboard (LSTM + ARIMA + Ensemble)

##  Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end time series forecasting system to predict weekly retail sales using both deep learning and statistical models. It integrates LSTM neural networks, ARIMA models, and ensemble forecasting into an interactive web dashboard for business-friendly analysis.

---

##  Objective

- Predict weekly sales for retail stores  
- Compare deep learning and statistical forecasting models  
- Evaluate forecasting performance  
- Visualize predictions with uncertainty estimates  
- Deliver insights through an interactive dashboard  

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- TensorFlow (LSTM)  
- Statsmodels (ARIMA)  
- Flask  
- Bootstrap  
- Chart.js

##  Models Implemented

###  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Sequence-based deep learning model  
- Captures long-term temporal dependencies  
- Handles nonlinear demand patterns  

###  ARIMA
- Classical statistical forecasting model  
- Effective for short-term trend prediction  
- Used as baseline comparison  

###  Ensemble Forecast
- Average of LSTM and ARIMA predictions  
- Improves stability and reduces variance

## Performance Metrics

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  

Used to evaluate accuracy across historical data.

---

##  Forecast Confidence Interval

Uncertainty bands computed using:

Forecast ± 1.96 × residual standard deviation

Provides risk-aware forecasting.
